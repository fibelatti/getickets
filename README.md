# GeTickets!

This website was developed as a project of HCI by students from FATEC-SP (Brazil). It serves as a tool that crosses information between APIs (Spotify and Bandsintown) to keep the user informed about shows happening in the user's city of interest. It also recommends new artits for the user, based on what he currently has saved to his library.

This project has no comercial intent.

# IMPORTANT!

Since this website is hosted at github, via github pages, all user information is stored using cookies. If you want to use the service, please refrain from using the same password used in other platforms as the "Login" module is there only to illustrate how the service would operate, yet it is fully functional.


To Do
------
1. Optimize for mobile.
